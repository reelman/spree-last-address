SpreeLastAddress
================

Relieves the customer of typing his address again on a second order. (As this unnecessary typing may lead to order abortion)

Prefills any address during checkout with the last used address.

No db changes, one query during checkout more.

Installation
=============
Just put in your Gemfile 

gem 'spree_last_address', :git => "git://github.com/dancinglightning/spree-last-address.git"

No assets, no migrations, not rake tasks.
